    <h1>About Cypress RP</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Cypress RP</strong> is a visionary whitelisted roleplay server for the upcoming <strong>GTA 6</strong> launch. Although the official release has been delayed until May next year, we're using this time to build something extraordinary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our experienced development team—known for creating several successful <strong>FiveM</strong> servers—is already hard at work crafting immersive minigames, many of which are playable right here on our website. We're not just building a server; we're building an ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
      A dedicated group of volunteers is actively shaping the future of the server, developing systems for <strong>character progression, gang dynamics, economic structures, crafting chains, civilian activities,</strong> and more. From <strong>group jobs</strong> to <strong>racing circuits</strong> and <strong>government oversight</strong>, every aspect of the game is being thoughtfully planned.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Cypress RP isn’t about rigid rules or fixed roles—we're building a <strong>community inspired by its players</strong>. We invite you to be part of this creative journey. Share your ideas for businesses, mechanics, and features. Help us build the ultimate roleplay world.
    </p>

    <p>
      While we await clarity on Rockstar’s new <strong>Project R.O.M.E.</strong> modding platform and how it may differ from FiveM, our commitment remains: when the tools become available, we’ll be ready. Our full server design will be locked in, and development will begin immediately. Our goal? To be one of the first and finest fully-featured GTA 6 RP servers—offering innovations and experiences you’ve never seen before.
    </p>

    <h2>About the Developers</h2>
    <p>
      Cypress RP is led by <strong>KSUIE_Gaming, Malthador,</strong> and <strong>Snalye</strong>—a trio of skilled developers with a proven track record of building immersive, high-performance RP environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn’t your typical click-and-wait gameplay. Our scripts focus on <strong>interactivity, immersion, and discovery</strong>, with hidden secrets, meaningful choices, and gameplay that connects every player to the greater world around them.
